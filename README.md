# GitHub Repos Fetcher

App that makes a request to the GitHub API, retrieves a list of the selected user's repos, and automatically saves results to the database after each search. Implemented with full CRUD functionality, including the ability to view saved posts on refresh (most recent 25 sorted by date last updated), add custom notes, and delete entries. Made with the MERN stack and React Styled Components.
